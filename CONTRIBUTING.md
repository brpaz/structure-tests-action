## Reporting issues

If you found any issue, feel free to submit a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/brpaz/structure-tests-action)

Before submitting a new issue, we encourage you to utilize the search functionality to check if a similar issue has already been reported. This ensures that we avoid duplication and allows us to focus on addressing unique problems effectively.

When creating a new issue, please provide the most information you can like application version, operating system, logs and stack traces and anything else that you think is relevant and can help the investigation process.

## Contribute with code

If you are a developer, and want to contribute with the code, please follow the next steps, to understand how to setup the development envrionment and our release process.

### Setup development envrionment

#### Using Devbox

The easiest way to setup this project on your local machine is to use [devbox](https://github.com/jetify-com/devbox).

Devbox is a command-line tool that lets you easily create isolated shells for development. You start by defining the list of packages required for your project, and Devbox creates an isolated, reproducible environment with those packages installed, using the powerfull [Nix](https://nixos.org/) under the hood.

You can install it using the following command:
```sh
curl -fsSL https://get.jetpack.io/devbox | bash
```

Then run `devbox shell` to start a shell, with all the tools installed by devbox.

> [!TIP]
> To learn more about Devbox, check the [Introduction guide](https://www.jetify.com/devbox/docs/) on Devbox website.


#### Using dev containers

If you use VSCode or GitHub Codespaces, we also provide a [Devcontainer](https://containers.dev/) definition that you can use. ItÂ´s simply a wrapper for Devbox, but allows to start coding right way, without even installing Devbox on your machine.

### Tools we use

- [Task](https://taskfile.dev/) a task runner / build tool, modern alternative to Make. Useful to define common tasks like build the application or run the tests. Run `task -l` or check [Taskfile.yml](Taskfile.yml) to see the available tasks.
- [lefthook](https://github.com/evilmartians/lefthook) -  Fast and powerful Git hooks manager for any type of projects. Useful to run tasks like linting and formatting, before commiting changes GitHub.
- [commitlint](https://commitlint.js.org/) - Lint commit messages ensuring a standard structure acorss all commits.

### Development lifecycle

This project follows [GitHub flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-github/github-flow) for managing changes.

When implmenting a new feature, start by creating a new branch from `main`, with a descriptive name (Ex: `feat/my-awesome-feature` or `fix/some-bug`).

Having a descriptive name helps to reason about the branches, when you have many.

Checkout to that branch and do your changes.

Some useful guidelines when working on feature branches:

- **keep it short lived** - Long running feature branches can lead to problems, like merge conflicts. You should aim to create a feature branch, for a feature than is small enough to be done in a few days.
- **rebase with main at least once a day** - this ensure you are always working with the most recent code and allows to fix any conflicts that might occurr, early in the process.

#### Submitting your changes for review

When you are ready create a Pull request to the main branch.

When creating a pull request, you should:

- Provide a descriptive PR title, following [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/) specification.
- Provide a short description of what changes you did, core architecture decisions you took, and link to any issue the PR might relate to.
- Ensure that any automated checks like Linting and Tests pass.

The PR will then be reviewed and changes may by requested. Keep commiting those changes, until the PR is approved.

After being approved, the maintainers will merge the PR to main branch and start the release process.

#### Commit guidelines

The project folows [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/) specification.

Each commit message should begin with a type, indicating the nature of the change (e.g., feat for a new feature, fix for a bug fix, docs for documentation changes), followed by a concise and descriptive message.

Additionally, providing an optional scope and further details in the commit message body is encouraged when necessary. This approach streamlines the review process, facilitates automated release notes generation, and enhances overall project maintainability.

We also recommend squashing your commits when appropriate.

## Release process

We use [Release Drafter](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/release-drafter) to automatically create draft releases with appropriate release notes, anytime a PR is merged.

When we are ready to create a new release, we simply publish the release, which will trigger GitHub actions, that will publish any related artifacts and commit a Changelog to the project repository.
